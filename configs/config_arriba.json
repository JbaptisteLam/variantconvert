Possible values are: translocation (between different chromosomes), duplication, inversion, and deletion. If genes are fused head-to-head or tail-to-tail, this is indicated as 5'-5' or 3'-3' respectively. Genes fused in such an orientation cannot yield a chimeric protein, since one of the genes is transcribed from the wrong strand. This type of event is equivalent to the truncation of the genes. The following types of events are flagged with an extra keyword, because they are frequent types of false positives and/or it is not clear if they are somatic or germline variants: Deletions with a size in the range of introns (<400kb) are flagged as read-through, because there is a high chance that the fusion arises from read-through transcription rather than an underlying genomic deletion. Intragenic duplications with both breakpoints at splice-sites are flagged as non-canonical-splicing, because the supporting reads might originate from circular RNAs, which are very abundant even in normal tissue, but manifest as duplications in RNA-Seq data. Internal tandem duplications are flagged as ITD. It is not always clear whether the ITDs observable in RNA-Seq data are somatic or germline variants, because ITDs are abundant in the germline and germline variants cannot be filtered effectively due to lack of a normal control."
